\section{Discussion}

Leveraging the modularity and agent-based structure of \Cyclus,
we can mimic the fuel cycle impact of \glspl{MSR} using a database
generated from a high-fidelity reactor physics calculation.
This database-approach outsources the computationally heavy
calculations outside the fuel cycle simulation, and allows
for quick, high-resolution implementation of complex systems
in the nuclear fuel cycle.
