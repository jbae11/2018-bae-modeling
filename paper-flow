There's a need to model MSRs in a fuel cycle simulation

Their behavior is weird, and material flow not discrete.

Continuous reprocessing makes depletion calculations difficult

Solution:
    Create an already confirmed design / parameters
    Run high-fidelity MSR simulation and save material flow in db
    Use the db to mimic MSR behavior in large-scale fuel cycle simulation
    Cyclus allows this to happen because it's an agent-based simulation

Flowcharts:
    Saltproc flow chart
    MSR material flow chart (Cyclus module flowchart - interactions with the market)

Results:
    Behaves exactly the same (1 reactor - 1 sink - sources simulation)
    Deployment into larger transition-scenarios sort of simulation
        reprocessing and all that
